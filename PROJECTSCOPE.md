MVP

The MVP of this app is to perform hexadecimal calculations with two color values.  There will be a starting hex value and an ending point hex value.  The output of the calculation will be the color segments in hex values displayed in a linear background color divided into the number of segments that the user specifies.

This project will adhere to good and proper use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  

This project will work as expected with no bugs.

This project will contain at least three distinct pages with clear navigation, one of which must be an "About Us" page.
This project will have at least two pages that accept and process user input.
This project will implement a state that persists between page reloads.  The next time the user returns to the app, local storage will contain the gradient colors from the previous session.
This project will be deployed live on the Internet via GitHub Pages.

Stretch Goals

On the About Us page, include animation on the picture cards that reflects our favorite color gradient.

The app will contain an examples page contain a chart that renders color gradients.  

The app will contain an animation of balls that will move in a wave formation with each ball colored with one of the hex values. 

Make a gradient with more than two starting colors.  There would be a starting color on the left, an ending color on the right, and one or more specified colors in between the starting color and the ending color.

Include a button to copy the full array of hex values so that the user can put this array of hex values into Chart.js.
